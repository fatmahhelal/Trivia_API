# Full Stack API Final Project

## Full Stack Trivia

Trivia API is a web application to hold trivia on a regular basis and the quiz game. The application has many functions as the following :

1) Display questions - both all questions and by category. Questions should show the question, category and difficulty rating by default and can show/hide the answer. 
2) Delete questions.
3) Add questions and require that they include question and answer text.
4) Search for questions based on a text query string.
5) Play the quiz game, randomizing either all questions or within a specific category.

## About the Stack

### Backend

The `./backend` directory contains a partially completed Flask and SQLAlchemy server. Also, app.py that define  endpoints and reference models.py for DB and SQLAlchemy setup.
 
 [View the README.md within ./backend for more details.](./backend/README.md)
